Utah Valley University and the Role of Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education
A Visionary Approach to Learning and Innovation

Overview and Origin
Utah Valley University (UVU) has a distinguished history dating back to the early 1940s. Established in 1941 as Central Utah Vocational School (CUVS), the institution was founded to address the need for vocational training during World War II. Initially, it focused on providing practical skills to support the war effort, offering courses in welding, aircraft mechanics, and radio technology.
Post-World War II, the demand for vocational training persisted, leading to the renaming of the institution in 1947 as Utah Trade Technical Institute (UTTI) to reflect its expanded curriculum. The post-war era ushered in significant growth and development, with the school diversifying its programs to include business, health sciences, and construction trades.
In 1963, the institution transitioned to Utah Technical College at Provo (UTC), marking the beginning of its evolution from a purely vocational school to a broader community college. This transformation continued in 1977 when the college relocated to its current site in Orem, Utah. The new campus provided enhanced space and resources, facilitating the expansion of its student body and programs and underscoring the institution’s commitment to serving the educational needs of Utah County and surrounding areas.
The year 1987 marked another pivotal change when the institution was renamed Utah Valley Community College (UVCC), reflecting its development into a comprehensive community college. UVCC expanded its academic offerings, faculty, and facilities, emphasizing accessible and affordable education for a diverse student population.
A significant milestone was achieved in 2008 when the institution became Utah Valley University (UVU), symbolizing its ongoing growth and expanded academic mission. UVU began offering master's degree programs and significantly enhanced its research and academic capabilities.
UVU is funded approximately 23% by tuition and the remainder comes from state funds and grants. 

Business Activities and Landscape
Today, UVU stands as the largest public universities in Utah, serving over 45,000 students. This is largely due to an extensive range of programs, including associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees across various fields of study. UVU is recognized for its commitment to engaged learning, providing students with hands-on, practical experiences that prepare them for successful careers.
Due to the growth some of the challenges that UVU faces in trying to maintain the institutional mission are:
1.	General growth: UVU would like to continue growing the program however, does not want to lose touch with the individuals of each student and maintain a community, local school feel.
2.	Wide range of academic levels: UVU provides such a wide range of educational opportunities from certificate level to graduate degrees across over 100 programs and strives to meet each student wherever they are on their academic path, where these differ greatly.
3.	General National trend of declining enrollment: there is a national tend of declining University enrollment due to costs and a perceived disconnect between what is being taught and the “real world”.  It is important to keep costs down while keeping the educational programs relevant.

Who does UVU Serve?
According to the UVU student body is evenly split between 50% male and 50% female students. Additionally:
•	36% are first generation college students
•	51% work at least 21 hours per week while attending UVU
•	32% are aged 25 or older
•	40% are married or in a partnership
•	17% support at least 1 child
•	80% are employed
•	19% are persons of color. 
Utah has 16 state-funded higher educational institutions. UVU stands out due to its location in fast-growing Utah County, diverse academic programs, open enrollment, and concurrent enrollment options for high school students.

Measures of Success
Common measures of success for UVU and similar educational institutions are:
1.	Enrollment
2.	Retention
3.	Graduation
4.	Post Employment
Here is how UVU is currently tracking on these measures of success according to it’s website:
UVU’s enrollment is also on a steady increase enrolling a record number of 46,809 students for the 2024 fall semester, an increase of 4.83%. (https://www.uvu.edu/news/2024/10/uvu-enrollment-for-fall-2024.html)
In May 2024, Utah Valley University (UVU) achieved a 46% graduation rate, which is two years ahead of its original goal. UVU’s original goal was to increase it’s eight year completion rate from 37% to 45% by 2025.  The national average for undergraduates at public institutions is 63%. UVU also had one of its largest graduating classes in May 2023, with 8,517 students receiving degrees and certificates. (https://www.uvu.edu/news/2024/02/2024_02_14_graduation.html):

Technology at UVU
UVU supports 45,000 students and over 5,000 faculty and staff with a diverse technology stack. This includes recruitment CRMs, Canvas LMS, financial management software, auditing software, Power BI, payment processing systems, student mobile apps, and more. The technology at UVU operates like a small city, also supporting police/security, retailers, facilities, sports organizations, and community events.
Use of AI at UVU and Recommendations
Utah Valley University (UVU) is at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its educational framework, demonstrating a commitment to innovation and excellence. By leveraging AI technologies, UVU aims to enhance the learning experience, streamline administrative processes, and prepare students for a future where AI plays a pivotal role across various industries.

Current Initiative: TA in a Box
TA in a Box Pilot - is a compact learning tool that enhances student learning anytime, anywhere. It aggregates various app sources for class information, assignments, lectures, and announcements. 
Faculty benefit from an intuitive GUI that requires no complex setup, allowing quick class integration. This web app integrates with mobile apps, intranets, and websites via a clickable button. 
While it interfaces with Azure for functionality, content management relies on Canvas or UVU data systems. Any updates sync automatically with Canvas. 
TA in a Box is now in its second version deployed in 10 of the top courses. 
Fall of 2025 TA in a Box will include several features:
•	A conversational chatbot that leverages natural language processing technology to maintain a conversation with students as if it were their very own tutor.
•	Deep dives into lecture topics, allowing students to explore detailed information on specific topics covered in their class lectures.
•	A question history feature that maintains a brief history of the questions asked by students for easy reference and follow-up.
•	Clearer presentation of information, with improved display for clarity and ease of reading

Recommendations
Administrative Efficiency
One of the top recommendations for UVU is to increase administrative efficiencies by employing AI to optimize its administrative functions. 
The adoption of chatbots and virtual assistants to handle routine inquiries can free up administrative staff giving them time to focus on more complex tasks and on student needs. Although there have been some attempts to introduce chatbots and virtual assistants, 
they have not been readily adopted due to underdeveloped chatbot technology and lack of training. The recommendation is to develop more sophisticated AI tools and provide sufficient training to decrease resistance to these types  
Research and Development
Using AI systems to analyze data to improve resource allocation, predict enrollment trends, and enhance overall operational efficiency. This is likely one of the best advantages to manage the growth tactically and prepare correctly for the size of the student body.
The university's commitment to AI extends to research and development. UVU faculty and students are engaged in cutting-edge AI research, exploring areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics. These efforts not only contribute to the academic community but also position UVU as a leader in AI innovation.
